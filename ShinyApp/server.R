# Define server logic
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  # Data Exploration: Render selected plot
  output$explorationPlot <- renderPlot({
    # Add code to generate the selected plot based on user input
    # For example, you can use ggplot2 functions
  })
  
  # Modeling: Fit models and display summary
  observeEvent(input$fitModelsButton, {
    # Add code to fit linear regression and random forest models based on user input
    # Display model summaries and fit statistics
  })
  
  # Prediction: Get predictions based on user input
  observeEvent(input$predictButton, {
    # Add code to make predictions using the fitted models and display results
  })
}

# Run the Shiny app
